								<p>
									Pets bring happiness to the world. Our philosophy is to bring pets and humans
									together and increase the
									compassion on the planet. We believe that right from children to adults pets have a
									healing impact on each
									other. They bond and grow with each other and learn to care for each other. We feel
									this is the best way to
									make this planet a better place to live.</p>
								<p>If you can find a place for a pet in your heart, and a little space on your phone for
									our app, we can do
									wonders together! Come join us and love more, care more and give more!
